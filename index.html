    <h1>Project Team 17#: Topic, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Serenella Seba</strong>, <strong>Emma Nisenbaum</strong>, <strong>Ben Lichter</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p>The users we are catering to are the MBTA officials and others who would like these 
      visualizations in order to determine where the most fuel is being used, what type and how 
      much. From this, the MBTA should be able to determine figures like environmental impact, 
      costs, etc. The goal of these visualizations is to present both an overview of trends over 
      the years, as well as provide details on demand. It will be presented neutrally, yet still 
      “tell a story,” in order to best visualize where fuel has gone within the MBTA. </p>
    
    <p>The goal of this is rooted in concern for the use of fossil fuels in the public 
      transportation system. When pressed with a prompt in class that centered around the MBTA as a 
      whole, we wanted for any prestable problems from a different perspective. We chose energy 
      consumption and carbon emissions because there seemed to be little to no focus on the issue. 
      Though this came back to bite us a little due to the lack of data on the subject, we hope that 
      this project will serve to bring attention to what there is as much as what isn’t available. 
      We aren’t aiming to come up with any sort of solution but rather tell the facts as they are so 
      that the topic is able to gain more attention through any clear areas that could use improvement.</p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    
    </p>
    We used our two chosen visualizations, the line graph and the parallel diagram, 
    because we determined them to be very well suited for the portrayal of general 
    trends. If used in a business setting, we feel our graphs would be able to give
     immediate and clear impressions of questions like: "What is the most used fuel?"
      or "What fuel source fuels the most types of transport?" It was also with this 
      in mind we chose bright, identifiable colors. This logic was supported by our 
      interview, where the line graph was specifically supported due to the data needing 
      to show changes over time. And our class feedback, which praised its clarity 
      though pressed the need for filtering, which we were sure to implement. 

    </p>
    <p>
      The graphs themselves, if scrolled over with the mouse, allows the user to get 
      more information on the fuel source, mode of travel and miles traveled according 
      to the previous two categories. This applies to the dots on the line graph and 
      all the bars on the Sankey graph. The two graphs are also connected. If a line or 
      fuel source is selected on the line graph, the selection will be reflected in the 
      Sankey graph. This filtering means specific fuel sources can be viewed one at a time, 
      or in smaller groups, if further categorization is necessary.

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    

    
    <p>Our data comes from a dataset titled: Fuel and Energy, a publicly available 
      dataset from which we pulled our numbers about Year, Fuel Source, 
      Miles Traveled, and Mode of Travel. There were other categories, but we did 
      not use them due to them not fitting into our focus or finding them unclear.
       We cleaned the data by removing empty cells and transferring the data into a
        CSV file, then a json file.
      </p>
      
      <p>Looking at the visualizations we have themselves, it’s evident that the two 
        most popular fuel sources are Diesel and Electric Propulsion. While this does 
        at first glance indicate that the issue of carbon emissions or the over reliance 
        on fossil fuels is not as large as previously thought, taking a closer look at both 
        graphs, it’s not so simple. While it’s slight, the line graph makes it clear that 
        while Electric Propulsion does rest overall above Diesel, Electric Propulsions millions 
        of miles traveled experienced a slight decrease starting in 2018, while Diesel rose. 
        In addition, Diesel contributed to the most Modes of Transportation, and it’d be remiss 
        to forget that Gasoline and Compressed Natural Gasses add to the issue. So while Electric 
        Propulsion does contribute a significant amount, our visualizations make it clear it’s 
        not the dominant fuel source and thus, the MBTA is not as clean as it could be.
      </p>

    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>


    <p>Our tasks shifted as our focus narrowed down into our current topic and \
      found we were limited by a lack of appropriate datasets. There are a few 
      however, we prioritized:</p>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Analyzing annual trends in energy consumption and emissions.
          As mentioned previously, we were sorely disappointed by the lack of 
          available data of this type. However, we were definitely able to satisfy 
          the part of the task where we aimed to analyze trends in energy consumption, 
          expanding on that by what energy was consumed, where it went, and how many 
          miles were derived from it. </li>
        <li>
          Comparing each mode of transportation's miles traveled over instances of time.
          We were able to get this data from the Miles Traveled category of our dataset. 
          The logic being that it allowed for conclusions to be made about what the “best” 
          or most “efficient” fuel source was. If more fuel was dedicated to a service 
          that didn’t travel as much as another, that could be considered a source of 
          inquiry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Viewing trains by fuel type or line.
          The categories of Fuel Source and Mode allow us to summarize these aspects. 
          Different types of fuel fuel different modes of transportation found within 
          the MBTA. And, as seen by our parallel diagram, some overlap, while some don't.
           Our visualizations lend to a quick analysis of these clearly separated and 
           labeled categories.
        </li>
      </ol>


    <h1>Design Process</h1>
  

    <p>
      Our designs stemmed from a rough draft where we explored the best way to represent the complex dataset we had.
       We used size to create immediate visible differences between the amounts of fuel used, while the use of color to represent fuel types helped make the data more digestible. 
       From there, we transcribed the sketch into PowerPoint and Tableau, where we created the graphs with greater detail.
      During this process, we realized the necessity of having transparent links to avoid occlusion. 
      We decided to slightly lower the opacity of the links, so they would be followable even when they overlapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from this second draft that we determined how brushing and linking would function, how to filter the two graphs, and how users would interact with the visualizations to retrieve more details if desired.
      Details on demand became particularly important, as it was made apparent during our interview process that users needed access to specific data points without overwhelming the overall visualization.
      Another concern, raised by peer feedback, was that the initial color scheme was not colorblind-friendly. 
      To address this, we revisited and redesigned the color palette to ensure accessibility and inclusivity for all users.
      Lastly, the teaching team recommended adding dots at points corresponding to the years on the line chart to enhance clarity and display detailed information more effectively.
      Incorporating suggestions from our peers, and the teaching team and  was part of our iterative process, where continuous feedback and refinement allowed us to improve our visualization step by step.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p>In conclusion, this was a novel experience from beginning to end. Not only did we 
      not realize how much of this data was available to the public, we also didn’t realize
       there were so many tools available, such as D3 and Tableau, to express it. Graphs and 
       other visualizations were things we took for granted, and were majorly unaware how much
        science, math, and psychology went into development, though it seems a bit obvious in 
        hindsight. Creating this website allowed us the opportunity to make a real world application,
         and provided us with a hands on experience of the do’s and don’t of visualization creation.
    </p>
    
    <p>One improvement we could add include generally expanding more on the topic and combining 
      different datasets to provide a clearer picture of the real world situation. For example, an idea 
      we originally wanted to address is the idea of a fuel source, “efficiency.” This would be calculated 
      by determining the ratio of fuel consumption to passenger ridership in order to determine 
      which modes of transportation and fuel source was being used the most. Then from that data it could 
      be determined what was most valuable in investing in or working to decrease over time.
